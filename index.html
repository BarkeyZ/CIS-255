          <h3>Which hosting platform, (a), (b), or (c), above, do you think is best for keeping information about articles? Why?</h3>
          <p>Personally, I think the VDrive is my favorite way of storing my articles. It is easy to use, and so far it is performing well. I like the fact that it is associated with my svsu account, but I can see why that isn't the best in all situations. </br>
            That being said, the CSIS server may be way better, I just havent gotten it to work yet. 000WebHost seems like a great option for free webhosting, but as of right now I simply prefer hosting with svsu than another party. </p>
          <p><b>Edit: </b> The CSIS Server is working fine now.</p>

            <br><b>I chose to use the CSIS Server because I already am using github for this so I should get more expirience with other forms of web hosting.
              Plus I can use Notepad++ to edit my csis server.</b>

          <p>My List of things JQuery does different than Javascript:
            <ol>
              <li>JQuery handles getting info from elements differently. You can get elements by id, class, or tag like JS, but you use a much shorter $() instead.
              <li>JQuery has a totally different subset of events, event handling,  and manipulation, all of which are made easier by JQuery.
              <li>In JQuery you can call methods to change CSS directly on an object, rather than having to change the style tag
              <li>JQuery has support for different browsers, along with mobile vs desktop
              <li>JQuery enables forms of animation to be used inside your code with events or methods being executed
            </ol>
