  <p>Personally, I think the VDrive is my favorite way of storing my articles. It is easy to use, and so far it is performing well. I like the fact that it is associated with my svsu account, but I can seewhy that isn't the best in all situations. </br>
  That being said, the CSIS server may be way better, I just havent gotten it to work yet. 000WebHost seems like a great option for free webhosting, but as of right now I simply prefer hosting with svsu than another party. </p>
